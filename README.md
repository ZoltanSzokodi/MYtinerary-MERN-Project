# MYtinerary-MERN-Project
I have built this travel application based on Ubiqum Code Academy's MERN course. During the development of this project I've learnt the fundamentals of React Hooks and Context, plus state manangement with useReducer. The components and the styling are based on Material UI. The server side takeaways were handling the client-side requests (CRUD), server-side validation, model and schmea management with mongoose.

Features:
  - user authentication and authorization (email login, google login)
  - logout (both clearing JWT from local storage and server-side)
  - create new user / delete
  - check list of all users and see who is logged in (the plan is to convert this section to a real-time chat with socket.io)
  - search cities
  - post/update/delete itineraries
  - add itinerary to favorites/ remove (like button)
  - comment on itinerary / delete

Development time: 5 weeks
