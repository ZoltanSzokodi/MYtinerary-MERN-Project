# MYtinerary-MERN-Project
I have built this travel application based on Ubiqum Code Academy's MERN course. During the development of this project I've learnt the fundamentals of React Hooks and Context, plus state manangement with useReducer. The components and the styling are based on Material UI. The server side takeaways were handling the client-side requests (CRUD), server-side validation, model and schmea management with mongoose.

Development time: 5 weeks

Design: Mobile first
